It also does almost everything concurrently to maximize resource utilization. This means even faster installs.\n\n**Reliable:** Using a detailed but concise lockfile format and a deterministic algorithm for install operations, Yarn is able to guarantee that any installation that works on one system will work exactly the same on another system.\n\n**Secure:** Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package before its code is executed.\n\n## Features\n\n* **Offline Mode.** If you've installed a package before, then you can install it again without an internet connection.\n* **Deterministic.** The same dependencies will be installed in the same exact way on any machine, regardless of installation order.\n* **Network Performance.** Yarn efficiently queues requests and avoids request waterfalls in order to maximize network utilization.\n* **Network Resilience.** A single request that fails will not cause the entire installation to fail. Requests are automatically retried upon failure.\n* **Flat Mode.** Yarn resolves mismatched versions of dependencies to a single version to avoid creating duplicates.\n* **More emojis.** 🐈\n\n## Installing Yarn\n\nRead the [Installation Guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) on our website for detailed instructions on how to install Yarn.\n\n## Using Yarn\n\nRead the [Usage Guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/usage) on our website for detailed instructions on how to use Yarn.\n\n## Contributing to Yarn\n\nContributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Substantial feature requests should be proposed as an [RFC](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs). Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nSee [Contributing](https://yarnpkg.com/org/contributing/).\n\n## Prior art\n\nYarn wouldn't exist if it wasn't for excellent prior art. Yarn has been inspired by the following projects:\n\n - [Bundler](https://github.com/bundler/bundler)\n - [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo)\n - [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli)\n\n##
